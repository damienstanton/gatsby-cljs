Minimal example showing how shadow-cljs could be used together with gatsby to create static sites in CLJS.

`site` is a directory create by `gatsby new` with all the `.js` files removed. They will instead be generated by `shadow-cljs`. I nested the `site` directory in the `shadow-cljs` project but you can also nest the `shadow-cljs` directory in the gatsby root instead. I do not recommend mixing though.

## Run shadow-cljs

```
npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch gatsby
```

## Run gatsby separately

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
cd site
npm install
gatsby develop
```

## When done open in brower

```
open http://localhost:8000
```
